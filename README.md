### Hello 👋🏽 from Mehdi

Passionate software developer with 10+ years of experience driving quality and consistency throughout all phases of software development projects. A partner who leads collaborative efforts with analysts, QA and support engineers throughout a product lifecycle to produce high-quality, user-friendly, scalable and bug-free software. I credit my success to the fundamental belief that business needs must be fully understood and remain paramount throughout a project. Compounded by my core belief in Agile methodologies and extensive experience using a broad range of technologies, I’m able to document the most efficient architecture for a true end-to-end solution. Results remain unparalleled.
